At this moment I'm daily driving [tangled.sh](https://tangled.sh). That's not an endorsement for Bluesky, it's an endorsement for my friends!

### Find me on

- [tangled.sh/@lewis.moe](https://tangled.sh/@lewis.moe)
- [shitpost.fi](https://shitpost.fi)
- I may end up just self-hosting GoT and having files available on HTTP and FTP.
- (Soon TM) I will consider switching to forgefed when they actually have something to switch to.
