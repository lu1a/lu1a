## What's up people

I am not actively using GitHub.

At this moment I'm using [tangled.sh](tangled.sh). It's distributed yet has a synchronized auth system. I love tangled.sh despite the fact that I'm not a fan of an access-control/auth protocol (ATProto) which is driven by a corporation (bluesky). The day that `tangled` supports auth without requiring a bluesky account is the day I become a full `tangled` shill.

### Find me on

- [tangled.sh/@lu1.sh](tangled.sh/@lu1.sh)
- (Soon TM) own forgejo instance?
